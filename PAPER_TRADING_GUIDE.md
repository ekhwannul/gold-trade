## 📊 How It Works

### Position Calculation
```javascript
// BUY Position
Entry: ASK price (contoh: 2650.50)
Exit: BID price (contoh: 2655.30)
Profit = (Exit - Entry) × Lot Size × 100

// SELL Position  
Entry: BID price (contoh: 2650.50)
Exit: ASK price (contoh: 2645.20)
Profit = (Entry - Exit) × Lot Size × 100
```

### Example Trade
```
Signal: BUY
Confidence: 85%
Entry: 2650.50 (ASK)
Lot Size: 0.01

Price naik ke 2655.50
Current P/L = (2655.50 - 2650.50) × 0.01 × 100
            = 5.00 × 1
            = $5.00 profit ✅

Close position:
Exit: 2655.30 (BID)
Final P/L = (2655.30 - 2650.50) × 1
          = $4.80 profit

Balance: $10,000 → $10,004.80
```
